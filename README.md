# Pantry: Nashville Software School Capstone 1

Welcome to Pantry, an app that takes the food you have on hand and finds delicious recipes for you and your family!

## Getting Started

1. Create a local repository on your computer.
2. Fork or clone this project into your local repository.
3. Use `git init` in your command line to initialize the repository.
4. If forked, create your README and include any changes made.
5. If forked, use `git add .` and `git commit -m "first commit" in your command line.
6. Go to [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
7. Get your firebase Key, AuthDomain, and database URL and place those in an object returned by a function: `function fireBaseKey(){
    return{
    apiKey: "XxxXXXXXxxXXXXXX",
    authDomain: "pantry-xXXXxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://pantry-xXXXxx.firebaseio.com"
    };
}
`
8. Set Fire Base rules `{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
      "users": {
        ".indexOn" : ["uid"]
        },
      "recipes": {
        ".indexOn" : ["uid"]
      }
  }
}`
7. Go to [Spoonacular](https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition) and get yourself an API key.
8. Create another Javacript file that holds the API information: `let spoonKey = {
    apiKey: "xxxxXXXxxxXxXXxxxxXXxxx",
    domain: "spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.mashape.com",
    ingredients: "/recipes/findByIngredients",
  };`
9. Happy Coding!
